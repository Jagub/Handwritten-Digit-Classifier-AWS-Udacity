**Project Summary**

As a machine learning engineer, you’ve gained familiarity with deep learning, a powerful tool for a number of tasks – not the least of which is computer vision. 
As part of a new product, we have been asked to prototype a system for optical character recognition (OCR) on handwritten characters. Since the team is still collecting samples of data, we have been tasked with providing a proof of concept on the MNIST database of handwritten digits, 
a task with very similar input and output.
